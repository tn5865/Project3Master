# Self-Critique
- I feel I have learned a lot from where I was back in ITM 361. Regarding HTML and CSS, my knowledge increased, but not as much.
  However, I experienced a whole new understanding and appreciation for what was taught in this class. This class was titled 
  perfectly because it made me think and view web design differently in terms of color, structure, emotion, and other aspects
  of design language. It never occured to me how much information we are getting from websites subcouciously and I believe it is 
  amazing that we learned how to connect with a website's users through web design. 
  
# Group Project Critique
- I know I am suppose to do an individual assessment of each of my member, however I feel that we worked so well as a group that 
  I see us more as one unit than 5 seperate people working together. Alexander Keating is our lead for the login page, Jacob Krupa 
  for the welcome page, Stephan Tsang for the finance page and Lucero Garcia was lead for CSS with me helping out with CSS where ever 
  I can. Though my main role was upkeep of basecamp posts and the group's master repository. Everyone did excellent in their respective
  leads! When the project first started, due to also taking a Project Manangement class concurrently, I wanted to try to be the
  psuedo-leader for the group with establishing how we should communicate, when we should meet up, reminders for when things need to be
  done or when they're due, etc. However, after the first meetup session, I felt being a psuedo-leader was an unncessary endeavor on my 
  part due to the extraordinary effort my group displayed. There was never any major communication problems, deadlines were always met,     input and ideas were regarding the project were given post-haste, no personality clashes, etc. Although my favorite traits that were
  flourished among the group was the need to always contribute more and the capacity to always help each other out. During most of my past
  group project experiences, working with the other members usually felt more like a chore. This time around, it felt like a group of 
  friends all putting their best foot forward to accomplish a singular goal.
